## Try building with another build system (TryBuild Mode)

xmake v2.3.1 and above directly interface with other third-party build systems. Even if other projects do not use xmake.lua for maintenance, xmake can directly call other build tools to complete the compilation.

Then the user can directly use a third-party build tool to compile, so why use xmake to call it? The main benefits are:

1. Completely consistent behavior, simplifying the compilation process. No matter which other build system is used, you only need to execute the xmake command to compile. Users no longer need to study the different compilation processes of other tools
2. Docking the configuration environment of `xmake config`, reuse the platform detection and SDK environment detection of xmake, simplify the platform configuration
3. Docking cross-compilation environment, even for projects maintained with autotools, you can quickly cross-compile through xmake

Build systems currently supported:

* autotools (support for cross-compiling with xmake)
* xcodebuild
* cmake (support for cross-compiling with xmake)
* make
* msbuild
* scons
* meson
* bazel
* ndkbuild
* ninja

### Automatically detect build system and compile

For example, for a project maintained using cmake, executing xmake directly in the project root directory will automatically trigger a detection mechanism, detect CMakeLists.txt, and then prompt the user if cmake is needed to continue compiling.

```bash
$ xmake 
note: CMakeLists.txt found, try building it (pass -y or --confirm=y/n/d to skip confirm)?
please input: y (y/n)
-- Symbol prefix:

[ 81%] Built target png
[ 83%] Built target png_static
...
output to/Users/ruki/Downloads/libpng-1.6.35/build/artifacts
build ok!
```

### Seamless using xmake command

Currently supports common commands such as `xmake clean`,` xmake --rebuild` and `xmake config` to seamlessly interface with third-party systems.

We can directly clean the compiled output files of the cmake maintenance project

```bash
$ xmake clean
$ xmake clean --all
```

If you bring `--all` to perform the cleanup, all files generated by autotools/cmake will be cleared, not only the object files.

The default `xmake` is docked with incremental build behavior, but we can also force a quick rebuild:

```bash
$ xmake --rebuild
```

### Manually switch the specified build system

If there are multiple build systems under maintenance in a project, such as the libpng project, which comes with autotools/cmake/makefile and other build system maintenance, xmake defaults to using autotools by default. If you want to force switch to other build systems, you can execute:

```bash
$ xmake f --trybuild=[autotools|cmake|make|msbuild|..]
$ xmake
```

In addition, the `--trybuild=` parameter is configured to manually specify the default build system, and the subsequent build process will not prompt the user for selection.

### Fastly cross compile

As we all know, although many projects maintained by autotools support cross-compilation, the configuration process of cross-compilation is very complicated. There are still many differences in different toolchain processing methods, and many pits will be stepped in the middle.

Even if you run through a toolchain's cross-compilation, if you switch to another toolchain environment, it may take a long time, and if you use xmake, you usually only need two simple commands:

!> At present cmake/autotools supports cross-compilation of xmake.

#### Cross compile android platform

```bash
$ xmake f -p android --trybuild=autotools [--ndk=xxx]
$ xmake
```

!> Among them, the --ndk parameter configuration is optional. If the user sets the ANDROID_NDK_HOME environment variable, or if the ndk is placed in ~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle, xmake can automatically detect it.

Is not it simple? If you think this is not much, then you can directly operate `./configure` to configure cross-compilation. You can see this document for comparison: [Using NDK with other compilation systems] (https://developer.android .com/ndk/guides/other_build_systems # autoconf)

To put it bluntly, you probably have to do this, you may not be able to do it once:

```bash
$ export TOOLCHAIN=$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/$HOST_TAG
$ export AR=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ar
$ export AS=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android-as
$ export CC=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android21-clang
$ export CXX=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android21-clang++
$ export LD=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ld
$ export RANLIB=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ranlib
$ export STRIP=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android-strip
$ ./configure --host aarch64-linux-android
$ make
```

If it is cmake, cross-compilation is not an easy task. For the android platform, this configuration is required.

```bash
$ cmake \
     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
     -DANDROID_ABI=$ABI \
     -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=$MINSDKVERSION \
     $OTHER_ARGS
```

For the ios platform, I did not find a short-answer configuration method, but found a third-party ios toolchain configuration, which is very complicated: https://github.com/leetal/ios-cmake/blob/master/ios.toolchain.cmake

For mingw, it is another way. I have been tossing about the environment for a long time, which is very tossing.

After using xmake, whether it is cmake or autotools, cross-compilation is very simple, and the configuration method is exactly the same, streamlined and consistent.

#### Cross compile iphoneos platform

```bash
$ xmake f -p iphoneos --trybuild=[cmake|autotools]
$ xmake
```

#### Cross-compile mingw platform

```bash
$ xmake f -p mingw --trybuild=[cmake|autotools] [--mingw=xxx]
$ xmake
```

#### Using other cross-compilation toolchains

```bash
$ xmake f -p cross --trybuild=[cmake|autotools] --sdk=/xxxx
$ xmake
```

For more cross compilation configuration details, please refer to the document: [Cross Compilation](https://xmake.io/#/guide/configuration?id=cross-compilation), except for an additional `--trybuild=` parameter, all other cross-compilation configuration parameters are completely universal.

### Passing user configuration parameters

We can use `--tryconfigs=` to pass additional configuration parameters of the user to the corresponding third-party build system. For example: autotools will be passed to `. / Configure`, cmake will be passed to the` cmake` command.

```bash
$ xmake f --trybuild=autotools --tryconfigs="-enable-shared=no"
$ xmake
```

For example, the above command, pass `--enable-shared=no` to`./configure` to disable dynamic library compilation.

In addition, for `--cflags`,` --includedirs` and `--ldflags`, you don't need to pass` --tryconfigs`, you can pass the built-in parameters like `xmake config --cflags=` to pass through.

### Examples of compiling other build system 

#### General Compilation

In most cases, the compilation method after each docking system is consistent, except for the `--trybuild=` configuration parameter.

```bash
$ xmake f --trybuild=[autotools|cmake|meson|ninja|bazel|make|msbuild|xcodebuild]
$ xmake
```

!> We also need to make sure that the build tool specified by --trybuild is installed and working properly.

#### Building Android jni programs

If `jni/Android.mk` exists in the current project, then xmake can directly call ndk-build to build the jni library.

```bash
$ xmake f -p android --trybuild=ndkbuild [--ndk =]
$ xmake
```

We also provided [xmake-gradle](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-gradle) to build jni library in gradle, you can see [Uses xmake to build JNI in Gradle](https://xmake.io/#/plugin/more_plugins?id=gradle-plugin-jni)

## Automatically generate xmake.lua

we need not write any make-like file (xmake.lua, makefile.am, cmakelist.txt, etc.) and also build it directly.

It will scan all source files and generate xmake.lua automatically for building project.

And xmake will detect 'main' function in source file in order to distinguish between static libraries and executable programs.

(Currently, only projects with single-level directory are supported)

### Used scenes

1. Temporarily quickly compile and run some scattered test code
2. Try porting and compiling other open source libraries
3. Quickly create a new xmake project based on existing code

### How to use it

Execute xmake directly in the directory with the source code (no xmake.lua), and follow the prompts:

```bash
$ xmake
note: xmake.lua not found, try generating it (pass -y or --confirm=y/n/d to skip confirm)?
please input: n (y/n)
y
```

In addition, when there are other build system identification files (such as CMakeLists.txt), the process of automatically generating xmake.lua will not be triggered, but [Automatically detect build system and compile](#Automatically detect build system and compile) will be triggered first. If you want to force trigger the process of automatically generating xmake.lua file, you can run:

```bash
$ xmake f -y
```

### Compile open source libraries

Although this approach has some limitations, but it is sufficient to complie and run some temporary codes for testing. 

For example, we downloaded a zlib-1.2.10 source and want to compile it.

We only need to enter the zlib source directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ cd zlib-1.2.10
$ xmake
note: xmake.lua not found, try generating it (pass -y or --confirm=y/n/d to skip confirm)?
please input: n (y/n)
y
```

It's done, the output results: 

```

```

Xmake will scan the current directory to detect all source codes and it do not found main function.

So it should be static library project and we build it as a static library: libzlib-1.2.a

We did not write any make-like files (xmake.lua, ..) and did not use the makefile of zlib project.

It is compiled directly and a xmake.lua file was generated which we can edit this xmake.lua to build more complicated project. 

The content of the generated xmake.lua:

```lua
-- define target
target("zlib-1.2")

    -- set kind
    set_kind("static")

    -- add files
    add_files("./adler32.c")
    add_files("./compress.c")
    add_files("./crc32.c")
    add_files("./deflate.c")
    add_files("./gzclose.c")
    add_files("./gzlib.c")
    add_files("./gzread.c")
    add_files("./gzwrite.c")
    add_files("./infback.c")
    add_files("./inffast.c")
    add_files("./inflate.c")
    add_files("./inftrees.c")
    add_files("./trees.c")
    add_files("./uncompr.c")
    add_files("./zutil.c")
```

### Fastly compile and run testing code

For example, I want to write a simple program in the main.c only to echo 'hello world!'.

If we use gcc to compile and run it, need run two commands: 

```bash
gcc ./main.c -o demo
./demo
```

If we use xmake to run it, only need run:

```bash
xmake run
```

Or

```bash
xmake r
```

It's done, the output results is:

```
hello world!
```

If we have a lot of code files, need also run only one command:


```bash
xmake run
```

It's so easy and convenient.

### Multi-language support

This feature of code detection and real-time compilation not only supports c/c++, also supports objc/swift 
and it will support golang in future.

For example, we downloaded a ios open source framework code 'fmdb':


```
.
├── FMDB.h
├── FMDatabase.h
├── FMDatabase.m
├── FMDatabaseAdditions.h
├── FMDatabaseAdditions.m
├── FMDatabasePool.h
├── FMDatabasePool.m
├── FMDatabaseQueue.h
├── FMDatabaseQueue.m
├── FMResultSet.h
└── FMResultSet.m
```

There are no any make-like files in it's project directory.

We uses xmake to build it directly as a ios static library:


```bash
$ xmake f -p iphoneos; xmake
```

The output results are:

```
xmake.lua not found, scanning files ..

#### Manual configuration

we need add them before compiling if the source code requires some special compiler options

For example:

```bash
$ xmake f --cxflags="" --ldflags="" --includedirs="" --linkdirs=""; xmake
```

## Unity Build compilation acceleration

We know that C++ code compilation speed is usually very slow, because each code file needs to parse the imported header file.

With Unity Build, we accelerate the compilation of the project by combining multiple cpp files into one. The main benefit is to reduce the repetitive work of parsing and compiling the contents of the header files contained in multiple source files. The contents of the header files are usually It accounts for most of the code in the source file after preprocessing.

Unity build also reduces the overhead caused by having a large number of small source files by reducing the number of object files created and processed by the compilation chain, and allows inter-procedural analysis and optimization across files that form a unified build task (similar to optimization during effect linking ).

It can greatly improve the compilation speed of C/C++ code, usually by 30%. However, depending on the complexity of the project, the benefits it brings depend on the situation of the project.

xmake has also supported this build mode in v2.5.9. For related issues, see [#1019](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/issues/1019).

### How to enable it?

We provide two built-in rules to handle Unity Build for C and C++ code respectively.

```lua
add_rules("c.unity_build")
add_rules("c++.unity_build")
```

### Batch mode

By default, as long as the above rules are set, Unity Build in Batch mode will be enabled, that is, xmake will automatically organize and merge according to the project code files.

```lua
target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_includedirs("src")
    add_rules("c++.unity_build", {batchsize = 2})
    add_files("src/*.c", "src/*.cpp")
```

We can additionally specify the size of each merged Batch by setting the `{batchsize = 2}` parameter to the rule, which means that every two C++ files are automatically merged and compiled.

The compilation effect is roughly as follows:

```console
$ xmake -r
[11%]: ccache compiling.release build/.gens/test/unity_build/unity_642A245F.cpp
[11%]: ccache compiling.release build/.gens/test/unity_build/unity_bar.cpp
[11%]: ccache compiling.release build/.gens/test/unity_build/unity_73161A20.cpp
[11%]: ccache compiling.release build/.gens/test/unity_build/unity_F905F036.cpp
[11%]: ccache compiling.release build/.gens/test/unity_build/unity_foo.cpp
[11%]: ccache compiling.release build/.gens/test/unity_build/main.c
[77%]: linking.release test
[100%]: build ok
```

Since we only enabled the Unity Build of C++, the C code is still compiled one by one normally. In addition, in the Unity Build mode, we can still speed up the parallel compilation as much as possible without conflicting each other.

If the `batchsize` parameter is not set, all files will be merged into one file for compilation by default.

### Group Mode

If the automatic merging effect of the above Batch mode is not satisfactory, we can also use custom grouping to manually configure which files are merged together to participate in the compilation, which makes users more flexible and controllable.

```lua
target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_rules("c++.unity_build", {batchsize = 0}) - disable batch mode
    add_files("src/*.c", "src/*.cpp")
    add_files("src/foo/*.c", {unity_group = "foo"})
    add_files("src/bar/*.c", {unity_group = "bar"})
```

We use `{unity_group = "foo"}` to specify the name of each group and which files are included. The files in each group will be merged into one code file separately.

In addition, `batchsize = 0` also forcibly disables the Batch mode, that is, if there is no unity_group grouped code files, we will still compile them separately, and will not automatically turn on automatic merging.

### Batch and Group mixed mode

As long as we change the above `batchsize = 0` to a value other than 0, we can let the remaining code files continue to open the Batch mode in the grouping mode to automatically merge and compile.

```lua
target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_includedirs("src")
    add_rules("c++.unity_build", {batchsize = 2})
    add_files("src/*.c", "src/*.cpp")
    add_files("src/foo/*.c", {unity_group = "foo"})
    add_files("src/bar/*.c", {unity_group = "bar"})
```

### Ignore the specified file

If it is in Batch mode, because it is an automatic merge operation, all files will be merged by default, but if some code files do not want to participate in the merge, then we can also ignore them through `{unity_ignored = true}`.

```lua
target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_includedirs("src")
    add_rules("c++.unity_build", {batchsize = 2})
    add_files("src/*.c", "src/*.cpp")
    add_files("src/test/*.c", {unity_ignored = true}) - ignore these files
```

### Unique ID

Although the benefits of Unity Build are good, we still encounter some unexpected situations. For example, in our two code files, under the global namespace, there are global variables and functions with the same name.

Then, merge compilation will bring about compilation conflicts, and the compiler usually reports global variable redefinition errors.

In order to solve this problem, we need to make some modifications to the user code, and then cooperate with the build tool to solve it.

For example, our foo.cpp and bar.cpp both have global variable i.

foo.cpp

```c
namespace {
    int i = 42;
}

int foo()
{
    return i;
}
```

bar.cpp

```c
namespace {
    int i = 42;
}

int bar()
{
    return i;
}
```

Then, our merge compilation will conflict, and we can introduce a Unique ID to isolate the global anonymous space.


foo.cpp

```c
namespace MY_UNITY_ID {
    int i = 42;
}

int foo()
{
    return MY_UNITY_ID::i;
}
```

bar.cpp

```c
namespace MY_UNITY_ID {
    int i = 42;
}

int bar()
{
    return MY_UNITY_ID::i;
}
```

Next, we also need to ensure that after the code is merged, the definitions of `MY_UNITY_ID` in foo and bar are completely different, and a unique ID value can be calculated according to the file name, which does not conflict with each other, which is to achieve the following merge effect:

```c
#define MY_UNITY_ID <hash(foo.cpp)>
#include "foo.c"
#undef MY_UNITY_ID
#define MY_UNITY_ID <hash(bar.cpp)>
#include "bar.c"
#undef MY_UNITY_ID
```

This may seem troublesome, but the user does not need to care about these, xmake will automatically process them when merging, the user only needs to specify the name of the Unique ID, for example, the following:


```lua
target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_includedirs("src")
    add_rules("c++.unity_build", {batchsize = 2, uniqueid = "MY_UNITY_ID"})
    add_files("src/*.c", "src/*.cpp")
```

Dealing with global variables, as well as global macro definitions with the same name, functions, etc., can be used in this way to avoid conflicts.

## Remote compilation

Version 2.6.5 provides remote compilation support, through which we can compile code on a remote server, run and debug remotely.

The server can be deployed on Linux/MacOS/Windows to achieve cross-platform compilation, for example: compile and run Windows programs on Linux, and compile and run macOS/Linux programs on Windows.

Compared with ssh remote login and compilation, it is more stable and smoother to use. It will not cause ssh terminal input to be stuck due to network instability, and it can also quickly edit code files locally.

Even we can seamlessly implement remote compilation in editors and IDEs such as vs/sublime/vscode/idea without relying on the IDE's own support for remote compilation.

### Start the service

```console
$ xmake service
<remote_build_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9091 ..
```

We can also start the service and echo detailed log information.

```console
$ xmake service -vD
<remote_build_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9091 ..
```

### Start the service in Daemon mode

```console
$ xmake service --start
$ xmake service --restart
$ xmake service --stop
```

### Configure the server

We first, run the `xmake service` command, it will automatically generate a default `server.conf` configuration file, stored in `~/.xmake/service/server.conf`.

!> Version 2.6.5, the configuration address is in `~/.xmake/service.conf`. Subsequent versions have made a lot of improvements and separated the configuration file. If you are using version 2.6.6 or above, please use the new configuration file.

Then, we edit it, fixing the server's listening port (optional).

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    remote_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9691",
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/remote_build"
    },
    tokens = {
        "e438d816c95958667747c318f1532c0f"
    }
}
```

### Configure the client

The client configuration file is in `~/.xmake/service/client.conf`, where we can configure the server address that the client needs to connect to.

!> Version 2.6.5, the configuration address is in `~/.xmake/service.conf`. Subsequent versions have made a lot of improvements and separated the configuration file. If you are using version 2.6.6 or above, please use the new configuration file.

```console
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/client.conf
{
    remote_build = {
        connect = "127.0.0.1:9691",
        token = "e438d816c95958667747c318f1532c0f"
    }
}
```

### User authorization

!> Version 2.6.6 and above only supports user authentication, and version 2.6.5 can only connect anonymously.

Before the actual connection, we briefly introduce several authentication mechanisms currently provided by the services provided by xmake.

1. Token authentication
2. Password authentication
3. Trusted host verification

#### Token Authentication

This is also the default recommended method, which is more secure, more convenient to configure and connect, and does not need to enter a password every time you connect.

When we execute the `xmake service` command, a server and client configuration file will be generated by default, and a default token will be automatically generated, so the local direct connection does not require any configuration.

##### Server authentication configuration

The server can configure multiple tokens for authorizing connections to different user hosts, and of course, can share one token.

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    remote_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9691",
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/remote_build"
    },
    tokens = {
        "e438d816c95958667747c318f1532c0f"
    }
}
```

##### Client Authentication Configuration

The client only needs to add the token on the server to the corresponding client configuration.

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/client.conf
{
    remote_build = {
        connect = "127.0.0.1:9691",
        token = "e438d816c95958667747c318f1532c0f"
    }
}
```

##### Manually generate new token

We can also execute the following command to manually generate a new token and add it to the server configuration ourselves.

```bash
$ xmake service --gen-token
New token a7b9fc2d3bfca1472aabc38bb5f5d612 is generated!
```

#### Password authentication

We also provide an authorization mode of password authentication. Compared with token authentication, it requires users to enter a password every time they connect, and can only be connected after the verification is passed.

##### Server authentication configuration

For password authentication, we do not need to manually configure the token, just execute the following command to add a user. During the adding process, the user will be prompted to enter a password.

```bash
$ xmake service --add-user=ruki
Please input user ruki password:
123456
Add user ruki ok!
```

Then, xmake will generate a new token from the username and password and add it to the token list of the server configuration.

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    remote_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9691",
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/remote_build"
    },
    tokens = {
        "e438d816c95958667747c318f1532c0f",
        "7889e25402413e93fd37395a636bf942"
    }
}
```

Of course, we can also delete the specified user and password.

```bash
$xmake service --rm-user=ruki
Please input user ruki password:
123456
Remove user ruki ok!
```

##### Client Authentication Configuration

For the client, we no longer need to set the token of the server. We only need to add the user name that needs to be connected in the connection configuration to enable password authentication. The format is: `user@address:port`

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/client.conf
{
    remote_build = {
        connect = "root@127.0.0.1:9691"
  }
}
```

!> If the username is removed and the token is not configured, it is anonymous mode. If the server is not configured with a token, the authentication is completely disabled and the connection is made directly.

#### Trusted host verification

In addition, in order to further improve security, we also provide server-side trusted host verification. If the server-configured known_hosts list is configured with the ip address of the client host that can be connected,
Then only these hosts can successfully connect to this server, and other hosts' connections to it will be prompted to be untrusted and refuse the connection, even if token and password authentication are OK.

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/logs.txt",
    server = {
        tokens = {
            "4b928c7563a0cba10ff4c3f5ca0c8e24"
        },
        known_hosts = { "127.0.0.1", "xx.xx.xx.xx"}
    }
}
```

### Connect to a remote server

Next, we only need to enter the root directory of the project that needs to be compiled remotely, and execute the `xmake service --connect` command to connect.

If it is the token authentication mode, then no additional password input is required, and the connection is directly connected.

```console
$ xmake create test
$ cd test
$ xmake service --connect
<remote_build_client>: connect 192.168.56.110:9091 ..
<remote_build_client>: connected!
<remote_build_client>: sync files in 192.168.56.110:9091 ..

    [+]: .gitignore
    [+]: xmake.lua
3 files has been changed!
Archiving files ..
Uploading files with 1372 bytes ..
<remote_build_client>: sync files ok!
```

If it is password authentication, the user will be prompted to enter the password to continue the connection.

```bash
$ xmake service --connect
Please input user root password:
000000
<remote_build_client>: connect 127.0.0.1:9691 ..
<remote_build_client>: connected!
<remote_build_client>: sync files in 127.0.0.1:9691 ..

    [+]: src/main.cpp
3 files has been changed!
Archiving files ..
Uploading files with 1591 bytes ..
<remote_build_client>: sync files ok!
```

If the password is incorrect, an error message will be displayed.

```bash
$ xmake service --connect
Please input user root password:
123
<remote_build_client>: connect 127.0.0.1:9691 ..
<remote_build_client>: connect 127.0.0.1:9691 failed, user and password are incorrect!
```

### Remote build project

After the connection is successful, we can compile remotely like normal local compilation.

```console
$ xmake
<remote_build_client>: run xmake in 192.168.56.110:9091 ..
checking for platform... macosx
checking for architecture ... x86_64

```

### Run the target program remotely

We can also run and debug the compiled target program remotely like running and debugging locally.

```console
$ xmake run
<remote_build_client>: run xmake run in 192.168.56.110:9091 ..
hello world!
<remote_build_client>: run command ok!
```

### Remote Rebuild Project

```console

```

### Remote configuration compilation parameters

```console
$ xmake f --xxx --yy
```

### Manually sync project files

When connecting, the code will be automatically synchronized once, and the code will be changed later. You can execute this command to manually synchronize the changed files.

```console
$ xmake service --sync
<remote_build_client>: sync files in 192.168.56.110:9091 ..

<remote_build_client>: sync files ok!
```

### Disconnect from remote

For the current project, disconnect the connection, which only affects the current project, and other projects can still be connected and compiled at the same time.

```console
$ xmake service --disconnect
<remote_build_client>: disconnect 192.168.56.110:9091 ..
<remote_build_client>: disconnected!
```

### View server log

```console
$ xmake service --logs
```

### Clean remote service cache and build files

We can also manually clean any caches and build generated files from the remote.

```console
$ cd projectdir
$ xmake service --clean
```
## Distributed compilation

Xmake provides a built-in distributed compilation service, usually it can cooperate with local compilation cache and remote compilation cache to achieve optimal compilation acceleration.

Also, it is fully cross-platform supported, we not only support gcc/clang, but also Windows and msvc well.

For cross-compilation, as long as the cross-toolchain supports, we do not require the system environment of the server. Even if the server resources of linux, macOS and Windows are mixed, distributed compilation can be well realized.

### Start the service

We can specify the `--distcc` parameter to enable the distributed compilation service. Of course, if this parameter is not specified, xmake will enable all server-configured services by default.

```console
$ xmake service --distcc
<distcc_build_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9093 ..
```

We can also start the service and echo detailed log information.

```console
$ xmake service --distcc -vD
<distcc_build_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9093 ..
```

### Start the service in Daemon mode

```console
$ xmake service --distcc --start
$ xmake service --distcc --restart
$ xmake service --distcc --stop
```

### Configure the server

We first, run the `xmake service` command, it will automatically generate a default `server.conf` configuration file, stored in `~/.xmake/service/server.conf`.

```bash
$ xmake service
generating the config file to /Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server.conf ..
an token(590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b) is generated, we can use this token to connect service.
generating the config file to /Users/ruki/.xmake/service/client.conf ..
<distcc_build_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9693 ..
```

Then, we edit it, fixing the server's listening port (optional).

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    distcc_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9693",
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/distcc_build"
    },
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    tokens = {
        "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b"
    }
}
```

### Configure the client

The client configuration file is in `~/.xmake/service/client.conf`, where we can configure the server address that the client needs to connect to.

We can configure multiple server addresses and corresponding tokens in the hosts list.

!> Distributed compilation, it is recommended to use the token authentication mode, because the password mode requires a password to be entered for each server connection, which is very cumbersome.

```console
$cat ~/.xmake/service/client.conf
{
    distcc_build = {
        hosts = {
            {
                connect = "127.0.0.1:9693",
                token = "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### User authorization

For user authorization, please refer to [Remote Compilation/User Authorization](/#/guide/other_features?id=user-authorization)

### Connect to the server

After configuring the authentication and server address, you can enter the following command to connect the current project to the configured server.

We need to enter `--distcc` when connecting to specify that only distributed services are connected.

```bash
$ cd projectdir
$ xmake service --connect --distcc
<client>: connect 127.0.0.1:9693 ..
<client>: 127.0.0.1:9693 connected!
```

We can also connect to multiple services at the same time, such as distributed compilation and remote compilation cache services.

```hash
$ xmake service --connect --distcc --ccache
```

!> If there is no parameter, the default connection is the remote compilation service.

### Distributed compilation project

After connecting to the server, we can perform distributed compilation like normal local compilation, for example:

```bash
$ xmake
...
[ 93%]: ccache compiling.release src/demo/network/unix_echo_client.c ----> local job
[ 93%]: ccache compiling.release src/demo/network/ipv6.c
[ 93%]: ccache compiling.release src/demo/network/ping.c
[ 93%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/network/unix_echo_server.c. ----> distcc job
[93%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/network/http.c
[ 93%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/network/unixaddr.c
[ 93%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/network/ipv4.c
[ 94%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/network/ipaddr.c
[94%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/math/fixed.c
[94%]: distcc compiling.release src/demo/libm/float.c
[ 95%]: ccache compiling.release src/demo/libm/double.c
[ 95%]: ccache compiling.release src/demo/other/test.cpp
[ 98%]: archiving.release libtbox.a
[99%]: linking.release demo
[100%]: build ok!
```

Among them, the words with distcc are remote compilation tasks, and the others are local compilation tasks. By default, xmake also enables local compilation caching to cache distributed compilation results to avoid frequent requests to the server.

In addition, we can also open the remote compilation cache and share the compilation cache with others to further accelerate the compilation of multi-person collaborative development.

### Disconnect

```bash
$ xmake service --disconnect --distcc
```

### Specify the number of parallel compilation tasks

Let's briefly introduce the number of parallel tasks currently calculated by default based on the number of host cpu cores:

```lua
local default_njob = math.ceil(ncpu * 3 / 2)
```

Therefore, if distributed compilation is not enabled, the default maximum number of parallel compilation tasks is this default_njob.

If distributed compilation is enabled, the default number of parallel compilation tasks is:

```lua
local maxjobs = default_njob + server_count * server_default_njob
```

#### Modify the number of local parallel tasks

We only need to pass `-jN` to specify the number of local parallel tasks, but it will not affect the number of parallel tasks on the server side.

```bash
$ xmake -jN
```

#### Modify the number of parallel tasks on the server

If you want to modify the number of parallel tasks on the server, you need to modify the configuration file of the client.

```bash
$cat ~/.xmake/service/client.conf
{
    distcc_build = {
        hosts = {
            {
                connect = "127.0.0.1:9693",
                token = "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b",
                njob = 8 <------- modify here
            },
            {
                connect = "192.168.01:9693",
                token = "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b",
                njob = 4
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For each server host, add the `njob = N` parameter configuration to specify the number of parallel jobs that this server can provide.

### Distributed compilation of Android projects

The distributed compilation service provided by xmake is completely cross-platform and supports Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS and even cross-compilation.

If you want to compile the Android project, you only need to add the `toolchains` toolchain configuration in the server configuration, and provide the path of the NDK.

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    distcc_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9693",
        toolchains = {
            ndk = {
                ndk = "~/files/android-ndk-r21e" <------------ here
            }
        },
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/distcc_build"
    },
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    tokens = {
        "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b"
    }
}
```

Then, we can compile the Android project in a distributed way like normal local compilation, and even configure multiple Windowss, macOS, Linux and other different server hosts, as the resources of the distributed compilation service, to compile it.

Just download the NDK for the corresponding platform.

```bash
$ xmake f -p android --ndk=~/files/xxxx
$ xmake
```

### Distributed compilation of iOS projects

Compiling iOS projects is easier, because Xmake can usually automatically detect Xcode, so just switch the platform to ios like a normal local.

```bash
$ xmake f -p iphoneos
$ xmake
```

### Distributed cross compilation configuration

If we want to distribute cross-compilation, we need to configure the toolchain sdk path on the server, for example:

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    distcc_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9693",
        toolchains = {
            cross = {
                sdkdir = "~/files/arm-linux-xxx" <------------ here
            }
        },
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/distcc_build"
    },
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    tokens = {
        "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b"
    }
}
```

Among them, under toolchains, each item corresponds to a toolchain, here is configured as `cross = {}` cross toolchain, corresponding to `toolchain("cross")`.

In the toolchain, we can configure `sdkdir`, `bindir`, `cross`, etc., corresponding to the interface configuration of `set_sdkdir`, `set_bindir` and `set_cross` in `toolchain("cross")`.

If the cross toolchain is more standardized, we usually only need to configure `sdkdir`, and xmake can automatically detect it.

And client-side compilation only needs to specify the sdk directory.

```bash
$ xmake f -p cross --sdk=/xxx/arm-linux-xxx
$ xmake
```

### Clean the server cache

The compilation of each project on the server side will generate some cache files, which are stored according to the project granularity. We can use the following command to clear the cache corresponding to each server for the current project.

```bash
$ xmake service --clean --distcc
```

### Some internal optimizations

1. Cache server-side compilation results to avoid repeated compilation
2. Local cache, remote cache optimization, avoid unnecessary server communication
3. Server load balancing scheduling, rational allocation of server resources
4. Small files are compiled directly locally after preprocessing, which is usually faster
5. Real-time compression and transmission of large files, based on lz4 fast compression
6. Internal state maintenance, compared to independent tools such as distcc, avoids frequent independent process loading and time-consuming, and avoids additional communication with the daemon process

## Local compilation cache

By default, Xmake will enable the local cache. The version before 2.6.5 uses the external ccache by default, and after 2.6.6, Xmake provides a built-in cross-platform local cache solution.

Compared with third-party independent processes such as ccache, xmake's internal state maintenance is easier to optimize, and it also avoids frequent independent process loading and time-consuming, and avoids additional communication with the daemon process.

In addition, the built-in cache can better support cross-platform, and msvc on Windows can also support well, while ccache only supports gcc/clang.

Of course, we can also disable the cache with the following command.

```bash
$ xmake f --ccache=n
```

Note: Regardless of whether the built-in local cache is used, the configuration name is `--ccache=`, which means the c/c++ build cache, not just the name of the ccache tool.

If we want to continue to use other external caching tools, we can also configure it in the following way.

```bash
$ xmake f --ccache=n --cxx="ccache gcc" --cc="ccache gcc"
$ xmake
```

## Remote compilation cache

In addition to local caching, we also provide remote caching services, similar to mozilla's sscache, which is usually not used if it is only for personal development.

However, if a large-scale project is developed collaboratively by multiple people within the company, distributed compilation and local caching alone are not enough. We also need to cache the compiled object files to a separate server for sharing.

In this way, even if other people compile it for the first time, they do not need to compile it distributedly every time, and directly pull the cache from the remote to speed up the compilation.

In addition, the remote cache service provided by Xmake is also supported by all platforms, not only gcc/clang but also msvc.

### Start the service

We can specify the `--ccache` parameter to enable the remote compilation cache service. Of course, if this parameter is not specified, xmake will enable all server-configured services by default.

```console
$ xmake service --ccache
<remote_cache_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9092 ..
```

We can also start the service and echo detailed log information.

```console
$ xmake service --ccache -vD
<remote_cache_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9092 ..
```

### Start the service in Daemon mode

```console
$ xmake service --ccache --start
$ xmake service --ccache --restart
$ xmake service --ccache --stop
```

### Configure the server

We first, run the `xmake service` command, it will automatically generate a default `server.conf` configuration file, stored in `~/.xmake/service/server.conf`.

```bash
$ xmake service
generating the config file to /Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server.conf ..
an token(590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b) is generated, we can use this token to connect service.
generating the config file to /Users/ruki/.xmake/service/client.conf ..
<remote_cache_server>: listening 0.0.0.0:9692 ..
```

Then, we edit it, fixing the server's listening port (optional).

```bash
$ cat ~/.xmake/service/server.conf
{
    distcc_build = {
        listen = "0.0.0.0:9692",
        workdir = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/remote_cache"
    },
    known_hosts = { },
    logfile = "/Users/ruki/.xmake/service/server/logs.txt",
    tokens = {
        "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b"
    }
}
```

### Configure the client

The client configuration file is in `~/.xmake/service/client.conf`, where we can configure the server address that the client needs to connect to.

We can configure multiple server addresses and corresponding tokens in the hosts list.

```console
$cat ~/.xmake/service/client.conf
{
    remote_cache = {
            connect = "127.0.0.1:9692,
            token = "590234653af52e91b9e438ed860f1a2b"
        }
    }
}
```

### User authorization

For user authorization, please refer to [Remote Compilation/User Authorization](/#/guide/other_features?id=user-authorization)

### Connect to the server

After configuring the authentication and server address, you can enter the following command to connect the current project to the configured server.

We need to enter `--ccache` when connecting to specify that only the remote compilation cache service is connected.

```bash
$ cd projectdir
$ xmake service --connect --ccache
<client>: connect 127.0.0.1:9692 ..
<client>: 127.0.0.1:9692 connected!
```

We can also connect to multiple services at the same time, such as distributed compilation and remote compilation cache services.

```hash
$ xmake service --connect --distcc --ccache
```

!> If there is no parameter, the default connection is the remote compilation service.

### Disconnect

```bash
$ xmake service --disconnect --ccache
```

### Clean the server cache

We can also use the following command to clear the cache on the remote server corresponding to the current project.

```bash
$ xmake service --clean --ccache
```

And if we execute `xmake clean --all`, when the remote service is connected, all caches will be automatically cleaned up.

### Some internal optimizations

1. Pull the snapshot of the remote cache and send it back to the local through bloom filter + lz4, which is used to quickly determine whether the cache exists and avoid frequently querying the server cache information
2. With the local cache, you can avoid frequent requests to the remote server and pull the cache.
3. Internal state maintenance, compared with independent tools such as sscache, avoids frequent independent process loading and time-consuming, and avoids additional communication with the daemon process
