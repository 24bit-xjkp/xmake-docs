If users don't like xmake's default display color and style, we can use the following global configuration commands to switch to other configuration topics provided by xmake, for example:

```bash
$ xmake g --theme=dark
```

The default theme is named default. Here, we switch to the dark style theme to adapt to some scenes with a very light background and provide darker color output to avoid being unclear.

If we want to switch back to the default theme, we can directly type:

```bash
$ xmake g -c
```

or

```bash
$ xmake g --theme=default
```

In addition, xmake also provides a lot of interesting and practical built-in themes, everyone can try, the following will explain in detail.
