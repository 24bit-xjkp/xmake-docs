<p>If users don&#39;t like xmake&#39;s default display color and style, we can use the following global configuration commands to switch to other configuration topics provided by xmake, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ xmake g --theme=dark
</code></pre>
<p>The default theme is named default. Here, we switch to the dark style theme to adapt to some scenes with a very light background and provide darker color output to avoid being unclear.</p>
<p>If we want to switch back to the default theme, we can directly type:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ xmake g -c
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ xmake g --theme=default
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, xmake also provides a lot of interesting and practical built-in themes, everyone can try, the following will explain in detail.</p>
<p>!&gt; If you have a better theme, you are welcome to mention pr contribution, thank you very much!</p>
